# About Clara

I've always been passionate about animals, and I lived around them since I was a child. I had or used to interact with dogs, cats, cows, horses, birds, fishes, hamsters, rabbits, and even a goat named Little Louis (Luizinho in Portuguese).

When I was 5 I used to ask my grandpa to take me to see a cow called Mel. I loved to pet her and touch her soft skin. My grandpa used to say I'll be a veterinarian when I grow up. I didn't become a veterinarian, but I'm still passionate about animals. I'm the person who plays with the dog at the party instead of talking to people.

I have a dog named Lola. She was rescued from the streets in Brazil by a friend of mine who found her and her siblings in a box. She was 45 days old when I adopted her. We don't know her breed, and I don't care about it. 
When we moved to Canada, we brought her with us. She loved the cold weather and the park in front of our home. She's very happy here, and this is the most important thing for me. She is my soul dog <3
